[Intro]<br>
I've got another confession to make, I'm your fool<br>
Everyone's got their chains to break, holdin' you<br>
Were you born to resist or be abused?<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Are you gone and on to someone new?<br>
I needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose<br>
You gave me something that I didn't have, but had no use<br>
I was too weak to give in, too strong to lose<br>
My heart is under arrest again, but I break loose<br>
My head is giving me life or death, but I can't choose<br>
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
Has someone taken your faith?<br>
It's real, the pain you feel<br>
You trust, you must confess<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
Oh, oh oh, oh oh<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Has someone taken your faith?<br>
It's real, the pain you feel<br>
The life, the love you'd die to heal<br>
The hope that starts the broken hearts<br>
You trust, you must confess<br>
<br>
[Refrain]<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I've got another confession, my friend, I'm no fool<br>
I'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new<br>
Were you born to resist or be abused?<br>
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
Has someone taken your faith?<br>
It's real, the pain you feel<br>
You trust, you must confess<br>
Is someone getting the best<br>
The best, the best, the best of you?<br>
Oh, oh oh, oh oh<br>
